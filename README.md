# Chessboard Detection Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a computer vision system for detecting chessboards and chess pieces using OpenCV. It handles variations in angles and lighting, dividing the chessboard into an 8x8 grid and identifying pieces' positions.

## Features
- Chessboard detection using contours and perspective transformation.
- Chess piece detection using edge detection, color thresholding, and other techniques.
- Robust performance under various lighting and angle conditions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenCV 4.5 or higher
- NumPy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Chessboard_Detection_Project.git
